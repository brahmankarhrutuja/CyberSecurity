# Methods of Attack
1. Malware - software designed to harm devices or network.

2. Virus - A malware program that modifies other computer program by inserting its own code to damage or destroy data.

3. Worm - Malware that self replicates spreading across network and infecting computers.

4. Ransomware - Malicious attack during which threat actors encrypt an organizations data and demand payment to restore access.

5. Spyware - Malicious software installed on users computer without their permission, which is used to spy on and steal user data.

6. Phishing - The use of didgital communication to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

7. Spear Phishing - Malicious email attack targeting a specific user to group of users that appears to originate from trusted source.

8. Whaling - Form of spear phishhing during which threat actors target executives in order to gain access to sensitive data.

9. Password attack - A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data.

10. Social engineering attack - Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

11. Physical attack - A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. 

12. Supply-chain attack - A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. 
Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. 
These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them.
Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

13. Cryptographic attack - A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient.
