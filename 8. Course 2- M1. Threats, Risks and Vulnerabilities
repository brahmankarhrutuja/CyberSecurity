1) Threat - A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. 
            One example of a threat is a social engineering attack. 
            Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. 
            Malicious links in email messages that look like they're from legitimate companies or people is one method of social engineering known as phishing. 
            As a reminder, phishing is a technique that is used to acquire sensitive data, such as user names, passwords, or banking information.

2) Risks - Risks are different from threats. 
           A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. 
           Think of a risk as the likelihood of a threat occurring. 
           An example of a risk to an organization might be the lack of backup protocols for making sure its stored information can be recovered in the event of an accident or security incident. 
           Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels: low, medium, and high, depending on possible threats and the value of an asset.
                a) A low-risk asset: A low-risk asset is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised. 
                This includes public information such as website content, or published research data.

                b) A medium-risk asset: A medium-risk asset might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations. 
                For example, the early release of a company's quarterly earnings could impact the value of their stock
