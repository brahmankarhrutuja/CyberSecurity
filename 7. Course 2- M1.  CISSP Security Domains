                                8) Software development security

1) #Security and risk management: Defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations. 
        Let's discuss each area of focus in more detail:
        a) Risk mitigation: Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.
        b) Compliance: Compliance is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.
        c) Business continuity: Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

2) #Asset Security: The asset security domain is focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. 
                    This means that assets such as PII or SPII should be securely handled and protected, whether stored on a computer, transferred over a network like the internet, or even physically collected. 
                    Organizations also need to have policies and procedures that ensure data is properly stored, maintained, retained, and destroyed. 
                    Knowing what data you have and who has access to it is necessary for having a strong security posture that mitigates risk to critical assets and data.

3) #Security Architecture and Engineering: This domain is focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data. 
                                           One of the core concepts of secure design architecture is shared responsibility. 
                                           Shared responsibility means that all individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security. 
                                           By having policies that encourage users to recognize and report security concerns, many issues can be handled quickly and effectively.

4) #Communication and Network Security: It mainly focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. 
                                        Secure networks keep an organization's data and communications safe whether on-site, or in the cloud, or when connecting to services remotely.
                  For example, employees working remotely in public spaces need to be protected from vulnerabilities that can occur when they use insecure bluetooth connections or public wifi hotspots. 
                  By having security team members remove access to those types of communication channels at the organizational level, employees may be discouraged from practicing insecure behavior that could be exploited by threat actors.

5) #Identity and access management: The identity and access management (IAM) domain focuses on keeping data secure. 
                                    It does this by ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized. This helps prevent unauthorized users, while allowing authorized users to perform their tasks.
                                    Essentially, IAM uses what is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. 
                                    As an example, a cybersecurity analyst might be asked to ensure that customer service representatives can only view the private data of a customer, such as their phone number, while working to resolve the customer's issue; then remove access when the customer's issue is resolved.

6) #Security assessment and testing: The security assessment and testing domain focuses on identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. 
                                     Security assessments help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. 
                                     Organizations might employ penetration testers, often referred to as “pen testers,” to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor. 

                                     This domain suggests that organizations conduct security control testing, as well as collect and analyze data. 
                                     Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of conducting security audits to monitor for and reduce the probability of a data breach. 
                                     To contribute to these types of tasks, cybersecurity professionals may be tasked with auditing user permissions to validate that users have the correct levels of access to internal systems.

7) #Security operations: The security operations domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occurred. 
                         The cybersecurity professionals involved in this domain work as a team to manage, prevent, and investigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. 
                         These individuals are trained to handle active attacks, such as large amounts of data being accessed from an organization's internal network, outside of normal working hours. Once a threat is identified, the team works diligently to keep private data and information safe from threat actors. 

8) #Software development security: The software development security domain is focused on using secure programming practices and guidelines to create secure applications. 
                                   Having secure applications helps deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users.

                                   Security must be incorporated into each element of the software development life cycle, from design and development to testing and release. 
                                   To achieve security, the software development process must have security in mind at each step. Security cannot be an afterthought.

                                   Performing application security tests can help ensure vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated accordingly. Having a system in place to test the programming conventions, software executables, and security measures embedded in the software is necessary. 
                                   Having quality assurance and pen tester professionals ensure the software has met security and performance standards is also an essential part of the software development process. For example, an entry-level analyst working for a pharmaceutical company might be asked to make sure encryption is properly configured for a new medical device that will store private patient data.
