CISSP's EIGHT SECURITY DOMAINS: 1)  Security and risk management
                                2) Asset security
                                3) Security architecture and engineering
                                4) Communication and network security
                                5)

1) #Security and risk management: Defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations. 
        Let's discuss each area of focus in more detail:
        a) Risk mitigation: Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.
        b) Compliance: Compliance is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.
        c) Business continuity: Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.
2) # Asset Security: The asset security domain is focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. 
                    This means that assets such as PII or SPII should be securely handled and protected, whether stored on a computer, transferred over a network like the internet, or even physically collected. 
                    Organizations also need to have policies and procedures that ensure data is properly stored, maintained, retained, and destroyed. 
                    Knowing what data you have and who has access to it is necessary for having a strong security posture that mitigates risk to critical assets and data.
