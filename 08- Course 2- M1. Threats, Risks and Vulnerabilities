1) Threat - A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. 
            One example of a threat is a social engineering attack. 
            Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. 
            Malicious links in email messages that look like they're from legitimate companies or people is one method of social engineering known as phishing. 
            As a reminder, phishing is a technique that is used to acquire sensitive data, such as user names, passwords, or banking information.

2) Risks - Risks are different from threats. 
           A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. 
           Think of a risk as the likelihood of a threat occurring. 
           An example of a risk to an organization might be the lack of backup protocols for making sure its stored information can be recovered in the event of an accident or security incident. 
           Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels: low, medium, and high, depending on possible threats and the value of an asset.
                a) A low-risk asset: A low-risk asset is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised. 
                This includes public information such as website content, or published research data.

                b) A medium-risk asset: A medium-risk asset might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations. 
                For example, the early release of a company's quarterly earnings could impact the value of their stock.

                c) A high-risk asset: A high-risk asset is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation. 
                This could include leaked assets with SPII, PII, or intellectual property.

3) Vulnerability - A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. And it's worth noting that both a vulnerability and threat must be present for there to be a risk. 
                   Examples of vulnerabilities include: an outdated firewall, software, or application; weak passwords; or unprotected confidential data. People can also be considered a vulnerability. 
                   People's actions can significantly affect an organization's internal network. Whether it's a client, external vendor, or employee, maintaining security must be a united effort.

RANSOMWARE - Ransomware is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data then demand payment to restore access. 
             Once ransomware is deployed by an attacker, it can freeze network systems, leave devices unusable, and encrypt, or lock confidential data, making devices inaccessible. 
             The threat actor then demands a ransom before providing a decryption key to allow organizations to return to their normal business operations. 
             Think of a decryption key as a password provided to regain access to your data. Note that when ransom negotiations occur or data is leaked by threat actors, these events can occur through the dark web.

National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST), provides many frameworks that are used by security professionals to manage risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
Seven steps in the RMF: Prepare, categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, and monitor.
